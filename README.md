# DSA for Cracking the Coding Interview. Animated Examples for Faster Learning and Deeper Understanding.

## Welcome to Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

This course makes learning to code fun and makes hard concepts easy to understand.

How did I do this?  By using animations!

Animating the Data Structures & Algorithms makes everything more visually engaging and allows students to learn more material - in less time - with higher retention (a pretty good combination).

I will use these visuals to guide you, step-by-step, through the entire course.

The course also includes dozens-and-dozens of Coding Exercises. So you can immediately put everything into practice as soon as you learn it (a very important step).

All of this will help you to feel more confident and prepared when you walk into a coding interview.

I have made several Free Sample Videos available for the course so you can see the difference the animations make.

Also, I am very active on the Q&A, so I will be with you every_step_of _the_way.
